# Welcome to engcore

## Introduction

The purpose of **engcore** is to provide a means to create ES2015 representations of fragments of English as well as to provide various utilities for manipulating them.

More particularly:

- The various parts of speech such as words, phrases, and clauses can be represented as a hierarchy of nested objects.  These objects, hereinafter referred to as "part of speech representations" (POSR) are strictly data objects that are amenable to serialization.

- The information stored by a POSR is predominately grammatical configuration. For example, a POSR to describe a noun would contain a base string and configure the noun as singular or plural, possessive, proper, or whatever.  The other POSR work
exactly the same way.

- Given a POSR and its configured grammar, the actual text that should come from it is generated by this software and is not simply stored.

## What you need to know

**engcore** is written using ES2015.  It uses tape for testing. In order to run the test you may want to use babel-node. This comes from the babel-cli package.  We use coveralls for test coverage analysis.

**engcore** is meant to be a library. The only thing we execute in this package is the test.  **npm test** does that.

## Deployment ##

1. **npm run build** will transpile the contents of the src directory into the dist directory. The dist directory will later be committed to git.  Although we don't ordinarily want to put derived files into git, we do so here as a convenience.  In doing so, we can easily require/include from other packages, without worrying about transpiling there.

2. Commit and push to github.
